# Netsuite

Working with Netsuite can be slightly more complex than other ERPs I have experienced. It requires a lot more manual configuration to get the most out of the service. The other problem is that it has a limited user base that posts solutions. There are only a few good sources of tutorial information on Youbtube. Much of the official documentation that you have access to offers simple explanations for turning on switches. But attempting to understand how different modules interact with others is often quite difficult and not properly documented.

For the new user, there is also some difficultly in navigating the differing reporting structures in the default state. The interface is clumsy. The official docs do not provide strong examples of the required syntax. It is usually very trivial.

My hope with this repository is to provide a place for other Netsuite users (especially new users or less technical users to find a quick and easy way to get results.
